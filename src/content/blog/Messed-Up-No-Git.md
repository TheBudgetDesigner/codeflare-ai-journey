The painful story of how I lost weeks of work on a project — all because I didn’t use Git. A hard lesson learned the hard way.

## **The Setup:**

I was building a cool web app and kept all my code on my local machine. I thought, “I’m careful enough, I don’t need version control.” For a while, everything went smoothly. I’d save my files manually and back up sometimes — or so I thought.

## **The Mistake:**

Then, disaster struck. My computer suddenly crashed. The hard drive got corrupted, and I couldn’t access any files. No backup existed, and since I didn’t use Git or any version control, I had no way to recover previous versions of my code or even the latest working copy.

## **The Fallout:**

I was devastated. Weeks of work vanished in an instant. All those features, bug fixes, and improvements? Gone. Starting over felt overwhelming, but I had no choice. Without Git, I had no safety net — no commit history, no branches, no way to roll back or recover lost work.

## **The Lesson:**

This experience taught me a crucial lesson: never skip version control. Git is not just a tool for collaboration — it’s your insurance policy against loss. Now, I commit early and often, push everything to GitHub, and keep backups. It’s saved me from disaster more than once.

## **The Conclusion:**
If you’re coding without Git, stop now. Save yourself the headache. Use Git for version control, even if you’re working solo. It’s not just for teams; it’s for anyone who wants to protect their work and sanity.

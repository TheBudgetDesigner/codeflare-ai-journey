The complete story of my Discord bot project - from exciting idea to crashing reality, and what I learned from the wreckage.

## **The Idea:**

I wanted to build a Discord bot that could answer coding questions using AI. It sounded simple enough...

## **The Build:**

I used Node.js, Discord.js, and the OpenAI API. My bot could join servers, listen for messages, and reply with AI-generated answers.

## **The Flop:**

It crashed. A lot. Rate limits, bad prompts, and infinite loops. But I learned more from debugging than from any tutorial.

## **The Lesson:**

Every failure is a step forward. Now, I build bots that actually work (most of the time!).
